< Fibonacci Series >

• Create a program that displays the Fibonacci series upto n.
• The formulae for the Fibonacci series are:
Fn = Fn−1 + Fn−2 (1)
F0 = 0 F1 = 1 (2)
1. Get the user to enter the value of n.
2. Have a function that that has two arguments. On input the arguments have Fn−1 and Fn−2.
On exit they have Fn and Fn−1.
3. Use a loop to find the whole series upto n.
4. Print out the series.

	In this exercise we will be creating a function that displays Fibonacci sequence in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
>> We first print the first two terms of Fibonacci series i.e 0 & 1.
>> To print 3rd to nth term we define the function fibonacci using pointers as arguments 
   (Fn = Fn−1 + Fn−2)
>> Now we store Fn−1 as Fn and Fn−2 as Fn−1 and so on.






< Inverse Hyperbolic Tangent function >

1. Get the user in enter a real positive number delta.
2. Implement a function artanh1(x) as an approximation to this Maclaurin series. As the series
is infinite, we will set the function to stop when the element in the series is smaller than a
given precision, delta.
3. Implement function artanh2(x) using approximations to natural logarithms. Remember that
natural logarithms are already implemented in the language’s standard math libraries.
4. Write a main that will calculate arctanh(x) where x ∈ [−0.9, 0.9] and sampled every 0.01,
using both methods. Store the results for both methods in separate arrays.
5. Compare the accuracy of each method with each other (to 10 significant figures).

	For this exercise we will be creating two functions, one to calculate the hyperbolic arc tangent using Maclaurin series and the other using natural logarithm.
>> First we enter the delta value to calculate artanh(x) using Maclaurin series where x ∈ [−0.9, 0.9]
>> As given above, x moves from -0.9 to 0.9, for each step increase of x 
>> We calculate artanh1(x) using values of x and delta as given in the formula for Maclaurin series
>> Then we calculate artanh2(x) using formula for natural logarithm.
>> We print the difference between artanh1(x) - artanh2(x)
>> We observe the values follows a hyperbolic arc, ie, the value decreases till it reaches 0 and then we can see the increases again, for which x moves from -0.9 to 0.9.
