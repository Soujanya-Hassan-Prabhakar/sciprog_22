Practical 06

• Write a program to multiply two matrices, Cn×q = An×pBp×q. See Fig. 1 for an illustration of the
problem.
1. Define n = 5, p = 3, and q = 4.
2. Declare three arrays A, B, and C of type double or real.
3. Initialise the C to zero and
(a) Ai j = i + j,
(b) and Bi j = i − j.
4. Use the schematic below to determine the elements of C.
5. Print out the three arrays (with one row of the matrix per line) to the screen and ensure that
you are generating the correct result.
6. If you have time create two files a main and matmult function. Have matmult return C to
main.
7. Construct a Makefile that will compile the two files to generate the executable.


	This exercise illustrates the multiplication of two matrices of length (n x p) &(p x q), the resulting matrix will be of length (n x q).
>> To create matrices, we require two dimensional arrays of given lengths.
>> We can compute the values of matrices using for loops as shown where i represents the row numbers and j represents column numbers.
>> We then initialise of matrix C to zero before performing matrix multiplication.
>> Since there are three different variables n,p,q we use 3 different matrix indices i,j,k respectively.

>> We can use make file to execute the same program.
>> we will create a matrix_mul.c file to define the matrix multiplication in a function and a main.c function in which the matrix multiplication function is called.
>> We create object file for both of these .c file
>> When we have multiple files then we can write command in Makefile to create Object files for each source file. If you do this – only those files will be compiled which are modified.
>> The same is shown in the example here.
